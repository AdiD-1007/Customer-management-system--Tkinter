# Employee management system
## Designed and developed an Employee Management System during my 6 months internship using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL. Created an user-friendly GUI (Tkinter) to efficiently manage employee records, including personal information, salary details, performance metrics. Utilized MySQL for secure and reliable data storage and retrieval. Improved operational efficiency and data accuracy.
